# U2.W4: Pad an Array

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: Celeen Rush].

# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# an array, the arguments: minimum length, filler
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# the array with the minimum length and filler
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
# Create a class array
# define a method, pad, that checks for the length of the array.
# takes two arguments: minimum length, and filler, by default set to nil
# see if it meets the minimum length,
#   if it meets the minimum length, 
#   return array
#   if it's less than minimum length,
#       take minimum length minus the length of the array = filler spaces
#       create an array from 'filler' of the 'filler spaces' length
#       concatenate the original array with filler array
#   return array


# 2. Initial Solution

class Array
  def pad!(number, filler = nil)
    if self.length >= number
      self
    else
      filler_spaces = number - self.length
      filler_spaces.times { self << filler }
    end
    return self

  end

  def pad(number, filler = nil)
    array = self.clone
    if array.length >= number
        array
    else
        filler_spaces = number - array.length
        filler_spaces.times { array << filler }
    end
  return array
  end
end

# 3. Refactored Solution

class Array
  def pad!(number, filler = nil)
    self.length >= number ? self : (number - self.length).times { self << filler }
    self
  end
  
  def pad(number, filler = nil)
    array = self.clone
    array.length >= number ? array : (number - array.length).times { array << filler }
    array
  end
end

# 4. Reflection 

# It was enlightening to see out how pad method that takes only two argument could refer back to the array. It was also fun to be able to use ternary conditional expression to make the code looks more efficient.
